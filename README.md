🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
-

📖 Project Overview
-

The project uses supervised machine learning regression algorithms to analyze historical car sales data and predict prices for new inputs. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. A trained model then predicts the price based on user input.

This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment readiness.
