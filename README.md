# Car-Price-Prediction
Car Price Prediction is a machine learning–based project that estimates the market price of a used car based on various features such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. The system helps buyers and sellers make data-driven pricing decisions instead of relying on guesswork.
